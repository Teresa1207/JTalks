## Today  

<div class="fragment">
Combine a little bit from two of these areas: 
</div>

<div class="fragment">
1. Simulation approach towards understanding cognitive reserve
</div>

<br>

<div class="fragment">  

2. Discuss recent paper on cognitive reserve, genetic risk and AD phenotypes with an application in the **UK Biobank**. 

</div>  


## Cognitive Reserve: what it is and what it isn't 

<br>

<div class="fragment">  

- **Cognitive reserve (CR):** the capacity to maintain high cognitive functioning in the face of substantial neuropathology.

</div>

<br>

<div class="fragment">  

 - CR is <font color="#DC3220">**not**</font> related to differences in brain structure that could account for differences in function.  

</div>

<br>

<div class="fragment">  

- Education is commonly used as proxy for Cognitive Reserve (other proxys: occupation, childhood IQ)

</div>


## Why is it important?  

<div class = "fragment">    
<font size = "7" color="#009e73">**Phenotypes**</font> <font size = "6"> It can guide in understanding **what** to look for, **who** to look for, **where** to look, and **when** to look </font>
</div>

<div class="fragment">  

<font size = "7" color="#009e73">**Treatment**</font> <font size = "6"> In order to treat, we need to get to people early on in the disease process; are we missing people?</font>

</div>

<div class="fragment">  

<font size = "7" color="#009e73">**Prevention**</font> <font size = "6">  Cognitive reserve is a potentially modifiable risk factor; early life interventions</font>

</div>

<div class="fragment">  

<font size = "7" color="#009e73">**Clinical trials**</font> <font size = "6"> Inform participation criteria and evaluation of cognitive change amoung trial participants.</font>

</div>

<div class="fragment">  

<font size = "7" color="#d55e00">**Overall**</font> <font size = "6">  Understanding CR could potentially shed light on the course of AD pathology. </font>

</div>


## Motivation for this work 

<div class="fragment">  

### Two conflicting observations with two conflicting hypotheses

<div class="fragment">  

<font size = "8" color="#d55e00">Observations</font>

</div>  

<div class="fragment">  

1. People with high cognitive reserve, e.g., more education, have lower rates of dementia 
</div>
<br>

<div class="fragment">  

2. Among people already diagnosed with dementia, people with high cognitive reserve have faster rates of cognitive decline

</div>


<div class="fragment">
Why are we seeing these conflicting observations?
</div>

---  

<div>
<font size = 8 color = '#d55e00'>CR Hypothesis 1: Diagnostic Bias</font>
</div>

<div class = 'fragment'> 

Cognitive reserve delays diagnosis because it reduces the sensitivity of clinical diagnoses to underlying disease, it **does not** convey meaningful functional advantages to individuals 

</div>  

<div>
<font size = 8 color = '#d55e00'>CR Hypothesis 2: Meaningful advantages</font>
</div>   

<div class = 'fragment'> 

Cognitive reserve delays diagnosis because it provides delays in disease progression (or compression of morbidity), it **does** provides meaningful functional advantages to individuals

</div> 

---  

<font size = 8 color = '#d55e00'>CR Hypothesis 1: Diagnostic Bias</font> 

<div class = 'fragment'>

<font size = "8" color="#009e73">**Goal**</font>
</div>

<div class = 'fragment'>
To understand if CR conceptualized as diagnostic bias could explain the two patterns observed. 
</div>

<br>

<div class = 'fragment'>
<font size = "8" color="#009e73">**Obstacle**</font> 
</div>

<div class = 'fragment'>
Assessing the effects of diagnostic bias in real datasets is challenging
</div> 

<div class="fragment">  

We took a simulation approach

## Simulation: 5 step approach  

<font size = "6">

<div class = "fragment">
<font size = "7" color="#DC3220">Step 1:</font> Develop causal diagram; build code adaptable to test theories
</div> 

<div class = "fragment">
<font size = "7" color="#DC3220">Step 2:</font> Generate data as encoded by the causal diagram (assumptions, statistical associations, distributions)
</div>

<div class = "fragment">
<font size = "7" color="#DC3220">Step 3:</font> Estimate the effect of cognitive reserve on: dementia risk, cognitive decline post diagnosis.
</div>

<div class = "fragment">
<font size = "7" color="#DC3220">Step 4:</font> Repeat steps 2,3 many (10,000) times. 
</div>

<div class = "fragment">
<font size = "7" color="#DC3220">Step 5:</font>
Evaluate the contrast of the observed effect with the underlying true effect. This represents the bias caused by delays in diagnosis.
